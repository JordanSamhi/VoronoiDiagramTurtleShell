# Voronoi Diagrams Turtle Shell

This project is part of University of Lorraine initiation to research. This project aims to implements algorithms to generate Voronoi diagrams structures. Those diagrams are present everywhere in nature, espacially on turtle shells. This is what is implemented in this project, the generation of such diagrams on a turtle shell.

Construction : 

* The turtle shell has been generated using Bezier curves (The boundary representation has been computed using custom algorithm).
* Voronoi diagrams have been generated using Delaunay triangulation.
* Delaunay triangulation has been generated using St√©phanie Hahmann iterative algorithm.
